# femto-chat
A tiny, super minimal IRC client in D

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/35834.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/35834)

Built to learn more D, including templates. Check out [femto-chat.messages](source/messages.d) for some cool template serialization/deserializtion hacks.

## TODO

- Add terminal coloring
- Make it less glitchy
- Add support for more of the IRC protocol (instead of the bare minimum I have now)
